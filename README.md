# hello-world
im awestyn, yes it's spelt differently but pronounced like the average joe spelling of austin. my mom was knew i would be to much of a savage to have a generic spelling to my name. not that i have issue with is. when i meet another "austin", they're alright, but there is only room for one "austin" in this town................me!
